Twice cooked eel with preserved bean curb is one of Khmer Krom men favorite hot pots. While most Khmer Krom men prefers this dish for appetizer ”mahope sar”, the women prefers with rice or rice noodle.
Back home, we use only fresh water eel because it abundant, taste good and cheap. Fresh water eel or rice eel loves to travel, if their home dry out, these eel would “walk” on land (like snake) to find another home.

Eel hatched as females and their bodies got bigger when they turn into males.
